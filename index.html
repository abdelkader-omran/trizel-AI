  <h2>Overview</h2> 
  <h2>Extended Description</h2>

<p>
AUTO DZ ACT is a scientific algorithm designed for <strong>epistemic validation</strong>.
Its purpose is not to construct theories, optimize models, or interpret physical causes,
but to determine whether a given scientific claim is <em>experimentally decidable</em>
under explicitly stated conditions.
</p>

<p>
The algorithm operates by enforcing a strict separation between:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Theoretical output (T)</strong> — what a claim or model asserts should be observed</li>
  <li><strong>Empirical or observational data (E)</strong> — what is actually measured or recorded</li>
  <li><strong>Decision thresholds</strong> — explicitly declared tolerances and comparison criteria</li>
</ul>

<p>
Given these inputs, AUTO DZ ACT deterministically assigns the claim to one of four
formal epistemic states:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>0/0 — Confirmed</strong>: Agreement between theory and data within declared thresholds</li>
  <li><strong>D0/DZ — Indeterminate</strong>: Data exist but lack sufficient discriminative power</li>
  <li><strong>DZ — Contradicted</strong>: Significant discrepancy under declared criteria</li>
  <li><strong>∞/∞ — Not Testable</strong>: Absence of comparable, well-defined, or accessible data</li>
</ul>

<p>
AUTO DZ ACT is <strong>deterministic</strong>, <strong>version-locked</strong>, and
<strong>audit-oriented</strong>. It does not assign probabilities, confidence scores,
or rankings, and it does not select between competing theoretical frameworks.
Its role is limited to answering a single question:
</p>

<p>
<em>Is this claim scientifically testable, undecidable, contradicted, or currently untestable
given the available data and declared criteria?</em>
</p>

<p>
The algorithm treats the <strong>absence of measurement</strong> as a first-class scientific
outcome. This prevents speculative inference, retrospective reinterpretation,
and premature theoretical consolidation in data-limited or frontier research contexts.
</p>

<p>
AUTO DZ ACT is intentionally <strong>model-agnostic</strong> and applicable across domains,
including but not limited to fundamental physics, astronomy, experimental sciences,
and any field where theory–experiment alignment is nontrivial.

</p>
  <p>
    AUTO DZ ACT is a deterministic, verification-first epistemic validation algorithm.
    It evaluates scientific claims by comparing theoretical outputs (T) to empirical or observational data (E)
    under explicitly declared thresholds, then assigns one of four epistemic states:
    0/0 (Confirmed), D0/DZ (Indeterminate), DZ (Contradicted), ∞/∞ (Not Testable).

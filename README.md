# TRIZEL-AI — Official Reference Portal

**Status:** OFFICIAL REFERENCE (Reference-Only)  
**Phase:** Pre-Execution (Freeze)  
**Authority Level:** Reference-Only Portal — Governance Enforcement Pending

TRIZEL-AI is the **authoritative scientific reference portal** for the TRIZEL research framework.  
This repository operates in **Pre-Execution (Freeze)** state. Execution, evidence ingestion, and
any operational activation remain **intentionally locked** pending successful and verifiable
governance enforcement checks.

This repository **does not claim execution**, compliance activation, or operational readiness.

---

## Official Reference Status (State Declaration)

As of the current state (**Pre-Execution — Freeze**), this portal is declared as:

- **The official reference interface** for TRIZEL documentation
- **A canonical index** of TRIZEL repositories and their declared roles
- **A multilingual documentation portal** (EN / FR / AR, ZH reserved)
- **A reference-only aggregator** of pointers to research artifacts with verifiable provenance

This status **does not imply execution, enforcement, or compliance activation**.

---

## Purpose and Scope

The TRIZEL-AI portal serves as:

### What It IS

**A Reference-Only Portal:**
- Authoritative documentation of TRIZEL methodology and architecture
- Registry-based index of federated TRIZEL repositories
- Evidence-first reference layer with immutable provenance pointers
- Multilingual documentation hub (EN / FR / AR with parity, ZH reserved)

**A Scientific Reference Infrastructure:**
- Static rendering of validated, version-controlled documents
- DOI-linked immutable archival records (via Zenodo)
- Transparent audit trails and version traceability
- Strict layer separation preventing interpretive contamination

**A Public Interface:**
- Read-only viewer and reference index
- Provenance-first presentation of research artifacts
- Governance-boundary-respecting display layer
- Professional scientific documentation access

### What It is NOT

This repository does **not**:
- Execute pipelines or ingest live evidence
- Perform scientific analysis or interpretation
- Claim governance compliance activation
- Exercise editorial or evaluative authority
- Generate or rank scientific hypotheses

Any analytical or computational intelligence, if present, originates **outside this portal** and
is not executed or controlled here.

## Phase Status Clarification

### Current Phase: Pre-Execution (Freeze)

**Execution State:** LOCKED  
**Governance Enforcement:** NOT ACTIVE  
**Deployment Authority:** BLOCKED

**Meaning:**
- Governance rules are defined but **not yet enforced automatically**
- No execution, ingestion, or operational workflows are enabled
- This portal reflects **state only**, not intent or future claims

### Unlock Condition (Explicit and Verifiable)

Execution may only be enabled when **all** of the following are true:

```text
GOVERNANCE_ENFORCEMENT = ACTIVE
REQUIRED_CHECKS = PASSING
BRANCH_PROTECTION = ENFORCED

# AUTO DZ ACT – Special Edition (v3.0 Gateway)

**Status:** Special Edition / Documentation & Access Gateway  
This repository provides documentation, presentation material, and a public gateway for **AUTO DZ ACT v3.0**.  
The **canonical, citable scientific definition** is **DOI-locked on Zenodo**.

---

## Special Edition Notice

This repository does **not** redefine the algorithm.  
It provides **human-readable documentation**, a **public gateway**, and **stable navigation** to the canonical Zenodo release.

---

## Scientific Update — January 2026

**Operational status:** Active and stable.  
Recent GitHub Pages build and deployment operations confirm **infrastructure integrity only**.

This website is intentionally **static** and governed by a **documentation-freeze and scientific integrity policy**.  
Displayed content changes **only** when source documentation files are explicitly modified, reviewed, and merged into the `main` branch.

Routine rebuilds do **not** imply scientific updates.

**Canonical authority:**  
The authoritative scientific definition of **AUTO DZ ACT v3.0** remains **DOI-locked on Zenodo**.  
This repository and website function strictly as a **documentation and access gateway** and do **not** redefine, extend, or reinterpret the algorithm.

## Overview

AUTO DZ ACT is a deterministic, **verification-first** algorithm for epistemic validation.  
It evaluates whether a claim is experimentally decidable by comparing theoretical outputs (T) to empirical/observational data (E) under explicitly declared thresholds.

---

## What AUTO DZ ACT Does (and Does Not Do)

**Does**
- Separates validation from interpretation (strict T vs. E discipline)
- Focuses on auditable decision rules and reproducible checks

**Does Not**
- Optimize models or propose physical mechanisms
- Assign probabilities, confidence scores, or rankings

---

## Four Epistemic States

- **0/0 — Confirmed:** agreement within declared thresholds  
- **D0/DZ — Indeterminate:** data exists but is insufficient to decide  
- **DZ — Contradicted:** significant discrepancy under declared criteria  
- **∞/∞ — Not Testable:** absence of comparable, defined, or accessible data

## Role of This Repository

This repository provides:
- Scientific documentation
- Presentation and educational material
- GitHub Pages as an access and navigation layer

It **does not** redefine the algorithm.

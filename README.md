## Scientific Update — January 2026

**Operational status:** Active and stable.  
Recent GitHub Pages build and deployment operations confirm **infrastructure integrity only**.

This website is intentionally **static** and governed by a documentation-freeze policy.  
Displayed content changes **only** when source documentation files are explicitly modified,
reviewed, and merged into the `main` branch.

Routine rebuilds do **not** imply scientific updates.

**Canonical authority:**  
The authoritative scientific definition of **AUTO DZ ACT v3.0** remains **DOI-locked on Zenodo**.  
This repository and website function strictly as a **documentation and access gateway** and do not
redefine, extend, or reinterpret the algorithm.

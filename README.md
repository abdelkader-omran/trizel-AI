# TRIZEL-AI (Descriptive Interface Repository)

TRIZEL-AI is a **non-authoritative, descriptive interface repository**
within the broader TRIZEL / AUTO-DZ-ACT research ecosystem.

This repository does **not** execute analysis, enforce governance,
or operate scientific workflows.
Its sole purpose is to provide **conceptual orientation, contextual explanation,
and navigational reference** across related research artifacts.

---

## Purpose and Scope

The role of this repository is strictly **descriptive**.

It documents:
- methodological intent
- conceptual boundaries
- historical phase structure
- relationships between research artifacts

It does **not**:
- generate hypotheses
- perform analysis
- rank theories
- enforce rules
- prevent or authorize execution

Any governance rules, execution constraints, or epistemic controls
are defined and enforced **elsewhere**, or exist only as
**historical documentation**.

---

## Relationship to TRIZEL Epistemic Engine

The core epistemic and governance framework of the TRIZEL program
is documented in the repository:

- **trizel-epistemic-engine** (archival, Phase-5 closed)

That repository is finalized and immutable.
This repository does not extend, govern, or continue that project.

Any references to phases, rules, or constraints are **historical only**
and carry **no active authority**.

---

## Phase References (Historical Context Only)

The TRIZEL program previously operated under bounded phases.
These phases are referenced here **for historical clarity only**:

- Phase-1: Conceptual precursor (external)
- Phase-2: Epistemic state definitions
- Phase-3: Deterministic execution boundaries
- Phase-4: Governance and evaluation limits
- Phase-5: Documentation finalization and closeout

No phases exist beyond Phase-5 within the TRIZEL Epistemic Engine.
Any future scientific work constitutes a **new project instance**
under a separate charter.

---

## Repository Ecosystem (Contextual Index)

During active research, multiple repositories served distinct roles.
Examples include:
- data snapshot repositories
- monitoring layers
- experimental analysis sandboxes

These references are **contextual and descriptive only**.
This repository does not coordinate, control, or activate them.

---

## Scientific Position

This repository makes **no scientific claims**.

It does not:
- interpret observations
- endorse models
- assert theoretical superiority

Its function is to **reduce ambiguity**, not to resolve it.

---

## Final Statement

TRIZEL-AI is a **documentation and orientation layer only**.

It exists to help readers understand
how different artifacts relate historically and conceptually,
without exercising authority or enabling execution.

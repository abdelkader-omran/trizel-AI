# Governance Reference for Open Source Projects

This document serves as a canonical pointer to the governance model, procedures, and community standards for this project, following best practices in open source community management. The intent is to clarify how decisions are made, how disputes are resolved, and where further details can be found.

## 1. Guiding Principles
- **Transparency:** All governance procedures and decisions are documented and publicly accessible.
- **Inclusivity:** Community feedback is valued, and processes welcome new contributors.
- **Responsiveness:** Issues are addressed in a timely manner; governance evolves as the community grows.

## 2. Governance Structure
- Project leadership is organized as maintainers or a core team.
- Roles and responsibilities are described in `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a dedicated GOVERNANCE.md, if present.

## 3. Decision Making
- Consensus-based: The preference is for broader agreement among maintainers and contributors.
- Escalation: If consensus cannot be reached, lead maintainers or a steering group make the final decision.

## 4. Policies and Procedures
- **Changing Governance:** All changes to governance documents require review and approval by the core team or maintainers.
- **Code of Conduct:** The project adopts a Code of Conduct, found in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` if present.

## 5. Reference and Relationships
- If this project adopts an existing governance model (e.g., [The TODO Group governance reference](https://github.com/todogroup/governance)), this document points to and incorporates that model by reference, unless overridden by additional local policies.

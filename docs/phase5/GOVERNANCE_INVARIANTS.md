# GOVERNANCE_INVARIANTS

Project: TRIZEL  
Phase: FINAL_EXECUTION  
Authority Level: ABSOLUTE  
Override: NONE  

---

## 1. Definition

Governance invariants are **non-negotiable rules** that apply across all phases,
repositories, and deployments.

They define what TRIZEL **can** and **cannot** do — permanently.

Violation of any invariant results in:
- immediate deployment block,
- invalidation of the affected output,
- mandatory corrective action.

---

## 2. Epistemic Authority Invariant

TRIZEL does NOT generate knowledge.

TRIZEL:
- exposes,
- evaluates,
- verifies,
- connects.

All epistemic authority remains with:
- data sources,
- repository authors,
- explicitly consented contributors.

No internal reinterpretation may override original authorship.

---

## 3. Non-Appropriation Invariant

TRIZEL shall never:
- claim ownership of external theories,
- absorb external work into internal doctrine,
- rebrand external results as TRIZEL output.

All external work requires:
- explicit author consent,
- clear provenance,
- immutable attribution.

See: `docs/legal/IP_NON_APPROPRIATION_POLICY.md`

---

## 4. Consent & Visibility Invariant

No theory, dataset, or analysis is displayed unless:

- the author has granted explicit consent, AND
- the epistemic status is declared, AND
- the provenance is traceable.

Silence does NOT imply consent.

---

## 5. Repository Boundary Invariant

Each repository is sovereign.

TRIZEL shall not:
- modify external repositories,
- inject logic into producer repositories,
- alter declared outputs.

The portal is a **viewer and aggregator only**.

---

## 6. Integrator Priority Invariant

Integrator outputs define system-level intelligence.

Therefore:
- integrator results MUST be displayed before producer results,
- producers cannot dominate global conclusions,
- isolated outputs cannot override integrated analysis.

---

## 7. Transparency Invariant

All public outputs must expose:
- source repository,
- commit or version,
- generation timestamp,
- epistemic status.

Opaque outputs are forbidden.

---

## 8. Audit Supremacy Invariant

The audit layer is authoritative.

If audit reports:
- failure,
- ambiguity,
- missing declaration,

then deployment is BLOCKED regardless of intent or urgency.

---

## 9. Language Parity Invariant (EN / FR)

All public content must exist in:
- English
- French

With:
- structural equivalence,
- semantic equivalence,
- legal equivalence.

Language asymmetry is a governance violation.

---

## 10. Immutability of Published Records

Once published:
- audit records are immutable,
- provenance links are immutable,
- historical outputs remain accessible.

Corrections require:
- new versions,
- new audits,
- explicit supersession.

---

## 11. No Exception Clause

There are:
- no emergency overrides,
- no administrative shortcuts,
- no implicit approvals.

Governance invariants apply universally.

---

## 12. Final Rule

IF any governance invariant is violated  
THEN deployment is BLOCKED  
AND remediation is mandatory.

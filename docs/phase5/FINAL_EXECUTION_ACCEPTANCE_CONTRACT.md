==================================

Project : TRIZEL Epistemic Operational Portal
Target  : https://trizel-ai.com/
Phase   : FINAL_EXECUTION (Phase-5)

----------------------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY
----------------------------------------------------------------
This contract defines the mandatory acceptance conditions for
FINAL_EXECUTION of the TRIZEL website.

It is a governance-binding document. Compliance with this contract is
a prerequisite for deployment eligibility and Phase-5 closure.

This contract supersedes informal approvals, verbal confirmations,
and non-versioned agreements.

----------------------------------------------------------------
2. SCOPE
----------------------------------------------------------------
This contract applies to:
- the TRIZEL website repository,
- all public-facing content exposed by the website,
- all build, validation, and deployment processes,
- all contributors and maintainers involved in Phase-5.

----------------------------------------------------------------
3. ACCEPTANCE PRINCIPLE (ABSOLUTE)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Acceptance is binary.

Either:
- ALL acceptance criteria are satisfied, or
- FINAL_EXECUTION is rejected.

Partial acceptance is not permitted.

----------------------------------------------------------------
4. CORE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (BLOCKER)
----------------------------------------------------------------
The following conditions MUST ALL be satisfied:

A. Epistemic Role Compliance
[ ] Website operates strictly as a viewer/aggregator
[ ] No analysis, inference, scoring, or interpretation performed
[ ] No narrative or editorial authority exercised

B. Scientific Traceability
[ ] Every exposed artifact is traceable to:
    - repository identity
    - version or commit reference
    - generation timestamp
    - epistemic status
[ ] No orphan or manually inserted content

C. Integrator-First Intelligence
[ ] Integrator outputs displayed before producer outputs
[ ] Producers do not visually dominate integrators

D. Multilingual Parity (EN/FR)
[ ] All public content exists in EN and FR
[ ] Identical structure and semantic meaning
[ ] No language asymmetry in claims, results, or legal terms

E. No Placeholder or Informal Content
[ ] Zero placeholder content present
[ ] No “coming soon”, “demo”, “sample”, or empty shells
[ ] Professional scientific tone enforced throughout

F. Publishing Discipline
[ ] Declared outputs only
[ ] Version-locked artifacts
[ ] Provenance metadata publicly visible

G. Governance Invariants
[ ] All governance invariants satisfied
[ ] No unresolved invariant violations

----------------------------------------------------------------
5. DEPLOYMENT GATE ENFORCEMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------
Deployment MUST be blocked if ANY acceptance criterion fails.

No override is permitted except:
- a formal governance waiver,
- committed to the repository,
- explicitly referencing this contract by commit hash.

----------------------------------------------------------------
6. VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
----------------------------------------------------------------
Acceptance verification requires:
- completed Phase-5 checklist,
- public audit metadata,
- gate-report artifact demonstrating pass/fail outcomes,
- confirmation that main branch integrity is preserved.

----------------------------------------------------------------
7. ACCEPTANCE DECISION
----------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL_EXECUTION is ACCEPTED only when:
- all BLOCKER items are satisfied,
- verification evidence is complete,
- governance approval is recorded in-repository.

Otherwise:
FINAL_EXECUTION is REJECTED.

----------------------------------------------------------------
8. LEGAL AND EPISTEMIC EFFECT
----------------------------------------------------------------
Acceptance of FINAL_EXECUTION certifies that:
- the website is scientifically valid,
- governance constraints are enforced,
- deployment risk is controlled,
- epistemic integrity is preserved.

----------------------------------------------------------------
9. RECORD AND VERSIONING
----------------------------------------------------------------
This contract must remain versioned.
Any modification requires:
- explicit justification,
- governance approval,
- new commit hash.

----------------------------------------------------------------
AUTHORITY
----------------------------------------------------------------
This contract is binding for Phase-5 FINAL_EXECUTION.
Non-compliance invalidates deployment eligibility.

=========================================

Project : TRIZEL Epistemic Operational Portal
Target  : https://trizel-ai.com/
Phase   : FINAL_EXECUTION (Phase-5)
Doc ID  : LEGAL-RESEARCHER-LIFECYCLE-v1.0
Status  : Governance-locked

----------------------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE
----------------------------------------------------------------
This document defines the formal process by which external researchers
may submit theories, frameworks, or analytical works to TRIZEL, and
how such submissions are handled throughout their lifecycle.

TRIZEL operates as an epistemic evaluator and connector, not as a
publisher or rights holder.

----------------------------------------------------------------
2. ELIGIBILITY FOR SUBMISSION
----------------------------------------------------------------
Eligible submissions include:
- original theories or frameworks,
- analytical methodologies,
- structured critiques or comparative analyses.

Submissions must:
- be authored by the submitter,
- have clear ownership,
- not violate third-party rights.

Anonymous or unverifiable submissions are rejected by default.

----------------------------------------------------------------
3. SUBMISSION CHANNEL
----------------------------------------------------------------
All submissions MUST occur through controlled, documented channels
defined by TRIZEL governance.

Public posting, informal contact, or unsolicited publication is not
recognized as a valid submission.

----------------------------------------------------------------
4. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------
Each submission MUST include:
- author identity and contact information,
- explicit ownership declaration,
- submission description and scope,
- reference to an existing publication platform (if any):
  - DOI
  - arXiv
  - Zenodo
  - institutional repository.

Absence of required information results in rejection without review.

----------------------------------------------------------------
5. INITIAL INTAKE REVIEW
----------------------------------------------------------------
Upon receipt, TRIZEL performs an intake review to verify:
- completeness of submission,
- authorship and ownership clarity,
- relevance to TRIZEL epistemic scope.

This review does not evaluate scientific correctness.

----------------------------------------------------------------
6. EPISTEMIC EVALUATION
----------------------------------------------------------------
If intake is successful, the submission enters epistemic evaluation.

Evaluation may include:
- structural coherence analysis,
- epistemic consistency checks,
- comparison with existing frameworks.

TRIZEL does not claim correctness or truth.
Evaluation status reflects internal epistemic assessment only.

----------------------------------------------------------------
7. LIFECYCLE STATES
----------------------------------------------------------------
A submission may exist in exactly one of the following states:

- Submitted
- Under Review
- Accepted for Reference
- Rejected
- Withdrawn by Author

State changes are documented and auditable.

----------------------------------------------------------------
8. ACCEPTANCE CONDITIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------
Acceptance means:
- the work may be referenced or analyzed by TRIZEL,
- the work may be linked through the portal,
- provenance and authorship are preserved.

Acceptance does NOT imply:
- endorsement,
- adoption as TRIZEL theory,
- transfer of rights.

----------------------------------------------------------------
9. REJECTION CONDITIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------
A submission may be rejected due to:
- incomplete documentation,
- unclear ownership,
- epistemic incompatibility,
- governance constraints.

Rejection does not imply scientific invalidity.

----------------------------------------------------------------
10. AUTHOR RIGHTS AND NON-APPROPRIATION
----------------------------------------------------------------
All rights remain with the author.

TRIZEL SHALL NOT:
- appropriate content,
- republish without consent,
- modify original work,
- restrict author’s external publication.

Author consent is required for any public exposure.

----------------------------------------------------------------
11. PUBLIC EXPOSURE RULES
----------------------------------------------------------------
If accepted for reference:
- exposure is limited to metadata and links,
- full content remains at author-controlled locations,
- epistemic status is clearly labeled.

No full-text hosting unless explicitly agreed.

----------------------------------------------------------------
12. AUDIT AND TRANSPARENCY
----------------------------------------------------------------
All submission states and decisions are:
- logged,
- traceable,
- available for audit.

Private correspondence remains confidential.

----------------------------------------------------------------
13. WITHDRAWAL
----------------------------------------------------------------
Authors may withdraw submissions at any time.

Upon withdrawal:
- references are removed,
- audit record is preserved.

----------------------------------------------------------------
14. GOVERNANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------
This lifecycle is governed by FINAL_EXECUTION rules.

Any deviation requires:
- governance approval,
- versioned amendment.

----------------------------------------------------------------
AUTHORITY
----------------------------------------------------------------
This document is binding for Phase-5 FINAL_EXECUTION.
Non-compliance invalidates deployment eligibility.
